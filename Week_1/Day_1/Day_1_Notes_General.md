# Notes for Day 1
Just some general notes or useful links that I came upon on the first day.

## Info
5 rules for defining functions reviewed below (taken from Compass):

* Give your functions precise verb/action based names
* Use camelCasedNames (like this one)
* Properly indent the function code
* Functions should focus on a single task: returning a value or causing a side effect. Break your function into     additional smaller functions if you find it doing two or more things
 * One single task could be to compute and return a value (eg: zeroPad)
 * Another single task could be to perform a side effect such as logging a message to the screen (eg: printFarmInventory)
* Data needed by Functions should be passed in as parameters/arguments (i.e. local scope) instead of being accessed directly


## Questions
* Is it generally bad practice to leave console.logs in a file?
